# UFOs
## Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage and dynamic table. In order to achieve this, I added a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results

In the following examples, I am going to describe how someone might use the new webpage by walking through the process of using the search criteria:

**Step 1: Analyzing the search filters**

In this screenshot of the webpage, you can see the following search filters on the left side: date, city, state, country, and shape. On the right side of the filters, you have the following column headers: date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments. You can filter most of the column headers to get a specific search result. 

**Step 2: Filtering 1 Search Filter**

In this screenshot, I filtered the date section to "1/13/2010." After entering this date, I got 3 results. This narrowed down the search drastically by filtering for an exact date. 

**Step 3: Filtering More than 1 Search Filter**

<img width="1180" alt="Screen Shot 2021-10-28 at 11 44 17 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88408350/139316568-9b4fa8aa-836d-4645-a5ce-cf4f08001354.png">

In this example, I added on to the date filter by typing in "triangle" in the shape filter. After plugging in these 2 filters, I come out with only 1 result. By doing this, each time I add a filter, I can get a more and more precise result. 

## Summary

One drawback of this webpage is that there is only one comment per sighting. It would be even more beneficial to the users if each sighting pulled as many comments from different sources to get a more credible finding. For the future, I would recommend some improvements for this website. The first one is the website should be up to date. Right now, we only have a limited selection of sightings from 1/10/2010-1/13/2010. Another recommendation is to create another section that puts in the time of the sighting. Having this additional filter will allow users to see if there are any patterns of when these sightings were seen.
